# Contributing to LLM Chess Arena

Thanks for your interest in helping build the LLM Chess Arena! This project is open-source and welcomes contributions from anyone excited about large language model matchups, 3D chess, and creative tooling.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/llm-chess-arena.git
   cd llm-chess-arena
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Contribution Workflow

1. Create a feature branch off `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes:
   - Follow the established file structure and patterns.
   - Keep components typed and lint-friendly.
   - Add tests when possible (coming soon!).
3. Run linting and formatting:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
4. Commit with a clear message and push your branch:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add descriptive message here"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request against `main` and describe:
   - What you changed and why
   - Any screenshots or screen recordings
   - How to test the change manually
